# Preliminary Design Goals

The preliminary design goals for the portable blood glucose measurement device were defined based on user needs and technical analysis:

- High measurement accuracy
- Minimal invasiveness for blood sampling
- Easy-to-use and intuitive interface
- Low-cost production for accessibility
- Energy-efficient design for extended battery life
- Reliable data storage and cloud sharing capabilities

These goals will guide the overall development process.
