# Sensor and Microcontroller Selection

After evaluating various sensor modules and microcontrollers, the following components were selected for the project:

- Glucose Sensor: XYZ-123 model was selected for its high accuracy and minimal invasiveness.
- Microcontroller: STM32 Nucleo board was chosen for its low power consumption, high processing speed, and compatibility with various sensors.

This selection aims to optimize measurement precision, energy efficiency, and ease of integration.
