# Preliminary Design Goals

The preliminary design goals for the portable blood glucose measurement device were defined based on user needs and technical analysis:

- High measurement accuracy
- Minimal invasiveness for blood sampling
- Easy-to-use interface
- Low-cost production
- Energy-efficient design for long battery life
- Reliable data storage and sharing capabilities

These goals will guide all design decisions throughout the project.
